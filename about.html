        <p>Hi, I'm Alistair Ruff, I'm a designer and user researcher. I currently lead the <a href="http://pdronline.co.uk/user-centred-design">User Centred Design team at PDR</a> and am studying part time for doctorate in service design.</p>
          
        <p>I spend my time planning and delivering user research to understand user needs, translating this research into actionable insight, and prototyping product and service designs. I do this alongside a talented team of design researchers who I support. </p>
          
        <p>If you want to see more, you can <a href="Writing/Portfolio_2020.pdf">Download my portfolio</a>, which shows some of the projects I've worked on in more detail.</p>
        
        <p>Or you can talk to me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/alistairuff">@alistairuff</a></p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Prior to working in the User Centred Design team, I worked with the <a href="http://pdronline.co.uk/service-design">Service Design team</a>, and even before that the <a href="http://pdronline.co.uk/ecodesign">Eco-Design team</a>.</p>
          
        <p>I'm completing a professional doctorate (like a PhD) part time. I'm researching how we could prototype services better, particularly interested in how we classify fidelity for service prototypes.</p>
        
        <p>Before PDR, I also worked on freelance and personal projects. I've created corporate presentations for a Multi-national steel company, 3D virtual models of renewable energy installations alongside a commercial photographer for planning applications and designed a <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/41233609/Audax-UK-Badges">range of badges for the UK's long distance cycling association.</a> </p>
        
        <p>I also work informally with friends and charities to lend design support on web, app and print projects whenever I can. I enjoy stretching my understanding of design and applying it in places and ways I hadn't previously expected.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and develop, The creation of this site is an output of that, simple but more than I could have done 6 months ago. I'm enrolled on a Professional Doctorate in Design, exploring how we as designers go about prototyping immaterial design outcomes, and how we could do it better. I'm trying to get better at engaging with and supporting the local design community in Cardiff too. I'm also trying to write more, but this is all a work in progress.</p>
