        <p>Hi, my name's Alistair. I lead the <a href="http://pdronline.co.uk/user-centred-design">User Centred Design team at PDR</a>. My work involves translating user insights and human factors testing data into design outcomes for our clients.</p>
        
        <p>Much of the work I've been involved with since joing the team isn't public yet, but you can 
          <a href="http://pdronline.co.uk/user-centred-design">read more about what the UCD team at PDR do.</a></p>
        
        <p>You can also talk to me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/alistairuff">@alistairuff</a></p>

        <p>Prior to working in the User Centred Design team, I worked with the <a href="http://pdronline.co.uk/service-design">Service Design team</a>, and even before that the <a href="http://pdronline.co.uk/ecodesign">Eco-Design team</a>.</p>
          
        <p>I'm also currently studying for a professional doctorate (like a PhD) part time. I'm researching how we could prototype services better, particularly interested in how we classify fidelity for service prototypes.</p>
        
        <p>Before I arrived at PDR, I also worked on freelance and personal projects. I've created corporate presentations for a Multi-national steel company, 3D virtual models of renewable energy installations alongside a commercial photographer for planning applications and designed a range of badges for the UK's long distance cycling association. </p>
        
        <p>I also work informally with friends and charities to lend design support on web, app and print projects whenever I can. I enjoy stretching my understanding of design and applying it in places and ways I hadn't previously expected.</p>

        <p>I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and develop, The creation of this site is an output of that, simple but more than I could have done 6 months ago. I'm enrolled on a Professional Doctorate in Design, exploring how we as designers go about prototyping immaterial design outcomes, and how we could do it better. I'm trying to get better at engaging with and supporting the local design community in Cardiff too. I'm also trying to write more, but this is all a work in progress.</p>
