       <h1>Life outside the Design Centre</h1>
        <p>The question I’ve been answering most often over the past 10 days is ‘So what are you doing now’? As if my master plan for world domination isn’t evident at the beginning of every conversation…</p>
        
        <p>I’ve now left University and Falmouth behind, heading off into the sunset with a 1st Class degree in 3D Design from University College Falmouth (Or Sustainable Product Design from Falmouth University, we’ll find out when I actually have a certificate!). It’s only really been 3 weeks since then, but reality hits hard and fast for us all. I’m now back in Cardiff happily in a flat in Cathays fortunate enough to not need to either be scraping rent together for a box room or back in with my parents. questions of work are continually flying around, my current response is ‘I’ve got some freelance work to keep me going’ to which either the response is very understanding or of total bemusement.</p>
       
       <h4>Self employed conversations</h4>
       
        <p>Being now officially self employed has meant most of my meaningful conversations have been with strangers e.g. the hairdresser on how he copes, or the guy I met at a wedding who has a degree in fisheries (seriously) and hires goldfish to weddings for centre pieces (alongside other work) on how that all started and where it’s going. Just trying to hold on to any nuggets of wisdom they may have, I must confess to not having fully committed to the whole self employed business…I’m still applying for ‘real’ jobs…I know, the man and all that. So that’s where I am right now.</p>
       
       <h4>Immediate plans</h4>
        
        <p>What have I been doing with myself then, and why haven’t I walked into that internship with that massive design consultancy yet? Well I’ve tried to put together some words to sum up my time so far out of Uni. As I write I’m also planning for two days of ‘Help, I’m a graduating designer, what do I do next’ run by Design Wales Forum, which should be an opportunity for more of the so trumpeted networking and making contacts. I also have a day of design workshops planned to take into my old High School for this coming Wednesday, giving something back and all that jazz! (Seriously though, I never studied D&T because I thought it was all about making tat out of perspex, and therefore this is what design was, being now a ‘real’ designer I want to let some kids know there is more to design than perspex tat). Then…find more freelance work?</p>
        
       <h4>New Designers</h4>
       
        <p>So what's happened? Well, whilst at New Designers (a massive exhibition for university design degrees to show their wares/tout for new students/graduating students to get jobs/contacts etc) I led a proper commuter double life. I woke and slept in an idyllic small town , Aston Clinton, cycled to the train in Wendover and caught the train into Marylebone each day. My first evening was spent demolishing an ageing treehouse with crowbars/hammers/saws…nice release for a design student. From there, setting up show, working our way round the other universities and admiring/comparing/contrasting/judging the standard of work to our own (we all do it unfortunately). The four very warm days of making contacts and talking about project work, all good fun when your feet weren’t on fire and the sweat patches were discreet enough for you to look approachable! All this was interspersed with visits back to the country for lovely cycles alongside the setting sun and fresh strawberries, good times!</p>
        
        <p>Overall, New Designers was a blast, good to see what the rest of the country has been up to in the design studios scattered throughout the UK. I enjoyed talking through my projects with anyone who seemed remotely interested and it was good to talk through the course and my experiences with people ranging from school teachers, parents and industry professionals. Feedback overall was warm and I’m following up on some leads already, hopefully with some exciting results. On the flip-side, slightly reinforced my frustrations with design awards. To cut a long short story short, I like design because it solves problems, so to see ‘in vogue’ furniture win awards slightly rubs me up the wrong way. Now call me biased/uninformed/utterly clueless (that’s what the comments section is for right?) but I saw plenty of really genuinely clever ideas at the show, and few of these got recognition from the awards panel. Fortunately I felt the Design Council's Future Pioneers choices better represent my graduating year’s ability to use creativity to solve some real problems.
</p>
        <p>After leaving London I headed back to Cardiff, got a fair few miles in on the bike, only to be back in the South East twice again in the past week for a friends wedding</p>
       
       <p>So I’ve got an interesting week coming up, hoping for good and real conversations about design and my future.</p>
